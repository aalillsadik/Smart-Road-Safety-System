# Smart-Road-Safety-System

## Components and circuit

Here i selected the required devices and understanding how they connect together. The aim of this project is to improve road safety by detecting vehicles, obstacles, and unsafe conditions, and then providing alerts when necessary.

I identified main control units like Arduino and Raspberry Pi, along with sensors that can detect distance, movement, and alcohol presence. GPS and GSM are used for location tracking and sending emergency messages. Displays and buzzers help show warnings, while cameras and RFID support monitoring and identification. Motors, relays, and power units are included to control actions and supply energy.

Here is the circuit diagram

## Prototyping 

To testing this thing i will build a prototype. Before that leets plan where and how all the components will set to the vehicle. 

What it should look in the real car.

## Work flow 

### **How it will works**

As there is a lots of reasons of happening accident i tried to solve this issue. 

Task view

- Start the vehicle after scanning the driver
- Check driver condition (Awake and not drunk)
- Over speeding ( According to the place speed limit will be set )
- In the night the High bim light will convert to low bim light automatically 
- Send alert on vehicle accident

Here is the flow chat show the thing will goes.

## Planning of the workflow

### Intro 

Now a days, we often heard about road accident, it may happen between two, three even four wheeler vehicle. there is couple of reasons of being happen. I have planned to make a device which i can install to these device and to alert the driver and prevent the accident.



Leets breakdown the thoughts then i will go to make the work flow
